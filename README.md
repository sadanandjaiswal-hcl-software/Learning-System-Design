# System Design

## OOPs
- Procedural Programming lacks: a) Real World Modeling b) Data Security c) Highly Scalable / Reusable

- **Objects have**: a) characteristics b) behaviours

- **oops**: real world objects interact

- **Encapsulation**: focus on Data Security
- **Abstraction**: focus on Data hiding, showing only the necessary part

## Solid Principles

### Problem Arries when SOLID Principles not followed
- Maintability : If want to introduce new feature so it should be easily available to introduce without affecting the earlier code 
- Readebility : Easiy to read and understand
- BUGs 

**SOLID (stand for)**
1. **S –** Single Responsibility Principle

2. **O –** Open-Closed Principle

3. **L –** Liskov Substitution Principle

4. **I –** Interface Segregation Principle

5. **D –** Dependency Inversion Principle
